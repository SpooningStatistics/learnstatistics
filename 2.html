    title="Python">
    Python</a></strong> is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
    Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
    Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace.
    It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.[26] Van Rossum led the language community until stepping down as leader in July 2018.
